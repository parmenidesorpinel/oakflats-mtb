Oakflats is a cross-country race part of the New Mexico Off Road Series. Oakflats started in 2007 with 7 riders, promoted by enthusiastic riders/parents. The race took off in 2010, and by 2011 was one of the top races with more riders and spectators in the State. Itâ€™s distinguished for being: a well marked course, kids course, family oriented, spectator friendly, with unique hand made trophies, a positive atmosphere and more. Oakflats was shut down for two years, during 2015-16. Now, we are back! and we offer a fast, flowy course with a little bit of everything. Join us!
